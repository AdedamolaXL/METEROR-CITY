# METEROR-CITY
From daos to decentralized cities.. This is an essay exploring trueblocks essay challenge for the regen rangers hackathons.

I have decided to weave all 9 topics into a subtle report loosely related to the famed spider group ‘phantom troupe’ from one of my favourite anime Hunter x Hunter.

Enjoy..
