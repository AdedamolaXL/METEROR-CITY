# METEROR-CITY
From daos to decentralized cities.. This is an essay exploring trueblocks essay challenge for the regen rangers hackathons.

I have decided to weave all 9 topics into a subtle report loosely related to the famed spider group ‘phantom troupe’ from one of my favourite anime Hunter x Hunter. Thus, this essay comes to you as a futuristic tale exploring the essence of decentralization, the transformative benefits, the potential pitfalls and how surveillance capitalism was defeated.
 
Enjoy..

## INTRODUCTION

In the summer of 2018, i got my hands on some VR googles that allowed me to travel into a book, in there i found a vibrant curious city known as Meteor City. Meteor City had just witnessed an extraordinary transfirmation from a dumping ground for technological waste into a magnificent decentralized city. through the activities of a DAO formed by one of its most popular scavenger group. This transformation had been heralded by a group of visionaries who formed a DAO named the ***phantom troupe**

The following report tells the story of how they made it happen:

1. ##### *Imagine a beautiful city built using technological waste that runs on a decentralized stack..*

Meteor City, is a testament to the transformative power of innovation, sustainability, and the creative reuse of technological waste. Born out of a collective desire to reimagine the potential of discarded technology, that accumulated in the wake of a technological revolution and threatened the well-being of the environment and humans. A group of visionaries recognized an opportunity amidst this crisis, seeing the remnants of obsolete devices as building blocks for a new kind of city—a city run entirely on a decentralized stack. 

Meteor City’s foundation lay in the creative repurposing of technological waste. Discarded computers, smartphones, and other electronic devices were salvaged, their components meticulously extracted and repurposed. Through innovative engineering and advanced recycling techniques, these discarded remnants were transformed into the building blocks of the city. Circuits became conduits of energy, screens morphed into solar panels, and processors evolved into intelligent infrastructure.

The city embraced the harmony between technology and nature. Lush gardens and vertical farms adorned the city, nourished by recycled water and nurtured by intelligent irrigation systems. The city's architecture seamlessly blended with the natural landscape, incorporating green spaces, rooftop gardens, and tree-lined streets. Meteor City became a sanctuary, where citizens could reconnect with nature and find solace in its serene beauty.

2. ##### *The importance of decentralization*

Meteor City thrived on a symphony of decentralized systems, where power, governance, and infrastructure were distributed among its citizens. Through blockchain technology, each individual became an active participant in decision-making processes, ensuring transparency, fairness, and inclusivity. Smart contracts governed resource allocation, enabling the city to optimize energy usage, manage waste disposal, and promote sustainable practices. *Meteorites* were no longer mere consumers but active contributors to the city's growth and well-being.

3. ##### *Blending Decentralization and Centralization*
          
>'Together, we are the Spider. I'm its head, and you're the legs. The legs do what the head says. But there will be times when the legs are more important than the head. If I die, someone else will take over. My orders are of the utmost priority. My life is not. Be sure to make the right decision. I'm only a part of the Spider. What's important is the survival of the whole, not the individual.'
